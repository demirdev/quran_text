# quran text pure dart and json 

## Features
- JSON Data Structure for using with any language
- Pure Dart Map for using with dart

## Why another Quran package ? 
Since most of the sources I have searched and found have gesture deficiencies, I shared the Quranic Arabic script on the website of the diyanet in the form of a dart class and json data structure.

## Source: [kuran.diyanet.gov.tr](https://kuran.diyanet.gov.tr)

## Usage

TODO: Include short and useful examples for package users. Add longer examples
to `/example` folder.

```dart
const like = 'sample';
```
